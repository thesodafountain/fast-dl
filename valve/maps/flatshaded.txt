Map Description         : This map was created for the snarkpit mapping contest. The contest aim was quite
			  free this time around, but early on the theme of flatshading was discussed and I
			  took it on board.

			  Please note that due to the deadline I was unable to run VIS fully. This is
			  despite leaving it to run on netvis with 4 powerful computers for many hours...
			  its not my fault, blame the hugely open layout and complex brushwork!

Misc Author Info        : This is my eleventh unique map release. I am a 20 year old currently studying
			  BSc Computer Games Technology at the University of Abertay in Dundee,
			  Scotland. Fingers crossed after getting this degree I will become a
			  fully fledged Level Designer working in the industry :) Outside of level
			  design I am a skateboarder, rollerblader, ice skater and snowboarder.
			  I listen to ska/punk/emo music and play a helluva lot of computer games! I
			  am also a member of a small student games development team based in Dundee...
			  not that we are currently very active!
