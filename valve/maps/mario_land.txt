To qUiCkSiLvEr for the mario player model,  the overviews, and all the superior technical work!
Your wisdom and help on this project was as always phenomenal and well done so much more than I
could ever imagine.  Your help with wavs, textures, and the outstanding Mario model is absolute
perfection.  Your work on this map has helped me to achieve a dream I've always wanted to do...
to make a Mario Half-Life map!  TAA!!  :)

to try and build one for Half-Life.
