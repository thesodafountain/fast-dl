Description: This is a Deathmatch Classic conversion of Valve's 2Fort for TFC. Nothing too special. I changed the skybox and lighting, gutted the spawnrooms, sealed off the flag basements, added weapon spawners, some ambient sounds, etc.
This was inspired by and is heavily based on the Open Fortress / TF2Classic dm_2fort and its weapon placements and layout changes.

This is the HLDM port of my DMC edit of 2Fort. Same map, different weapons and items.

Map info:
Time to make: About 3 hours (It's simply a modified version of 2Fort)
Compile time: 17.79 seconds
Editor used: J.A.C.K. Hammer

Entity Statistics:
24 Deathmatch spawns, 1 Singleplayer spawn.
